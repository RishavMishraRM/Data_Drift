# Data_Drift
Data drift is unexpected and undocumented changes to data structure, semantics, and infrastructure that is a result of modern data architectures. Data drift breaks processes and corrupts data, but can also reveal new opportunities for data use.

<br> <br> 
## Ways to Handle Data Drift
1. Reduce dependency on custom code
2. Minimize schema specification
3. Require fully instrumented pipelines
4. Decouple data pipelines from infrastructure
5. Build data pipelines for intent instead of semantics
6. Assume multiple platforms
7. Keep your focus on what matters
